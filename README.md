# X Content Deleter

Automate deletion of all posts, replies, and reposts from your X (Twitter) account using browser automation - completely free, no third-party services required.

## 🎯 What This Does

This tool uses Chrome DevTools browser automation to systematically delete:

- ✅ **All Posts** - Your original tweets
- ✅ **All Replies** - Responses to other users
- ✅ **All Reposts** - Retweets/reposts
- ✅ Works for accounts with <10,000 items (tested up to 1,000 items)
- ✅ No API keys or third-party services needed
- ✅ Free and open source

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

**Before you start:**

- ⚠️ **Deletions are PERMANENT** - Cannot be undone
- ⚠️ **Download your X archive first** - Backup your data at [x.com/settings/download_your_data](https://x.com/settings/download_your_data)
- ⚠️ May violate X's Terms of Service (use at your own risk)
- ⚠️ X may temporarily rate-limit or block your account
- ⚠️ Keep browser window open during entire process
- ⚠️ Takes 20-60 minutes for 1,000 items

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use with Claude Code (Recommended)

**Requirements:**
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/code) installed
- Chrome browser with [chrome-devtools MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/chrome-devtools) configured

**Steps:**

1. **Clone or download this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/x-content-deleter.git
   cd x-content-deleter
   ```

2. **Install the skill in Claude Code:**
   ```bash
   # Copy skill folder to your Claude Code config
   cp -r .claude/skills/delete-x-content ~/.claude/skills/
   ```

3. **Open Claude Code and invoke the skill:**
   ```
   # In Claude Code, type:
   Use the delete-x-content skill

   # Or just ask naturally:
   "Delete all my X content"
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Confirm you've backed up your data
   - Provide your X username
   - Let it run (20-60 minutes for 1,000 items)

### Option 2: Browser Console Script (No Installation)

**Requirements:**
- Chrome browser
- Logged into X account

**Steps:**

1. **Open X.com in Chrome**
   - Go to [x.com](https://x.com) and log in
   - Navigate to your profile

2. **Open DevTools Console:**
   - Press `F12` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (Mac)
   - Click the "Console" tab

3. **Copy and paste the script:**
   - Open [`src/delete-x-content.js`](src/delete-x-content.js)
   - Copy the entire Console Usage Example at the bottom
   - Paste into Console and press Enter

4. **Monitor progress:**
   - Script will log deletions: "Deleted 1", "Deleted 2", etc.
   - Keep the tab open and active
   - Scroll manually if script gets stuck

5. **Repeat for different content types:**
   - Run once on your main profile (deletes posts)
   - Navigate to "Replies" tab, run again
   - Refresh and repeat until all content is gone

## 📋 How It Works

### The Automation Process

1. **Navigates** to your profile tabs (Posts, Replies)
2. **Finds** tweet elements on the page
3. **Clicks** the "More" (⋯) button on each tweet
4. **Selects** "Delete" from the menu
5. **Confirms** the deletion dialog
6. **Waits** for appropriate delays (1 second between deletions)
7. **Scrolls** to load more content
8. **Repeats** until no more content exists

### Rate Limiting Protection

The script includes built-in delays to prevent triggering X's rate limits:
- **500ms** between menu clicks
- **1 second** between each deletion
- **3 seconds** after scrolling to load content

**Processing Speed:**
- ~0.5-1 tweets per second
- ~30-60 tweets per minute
- ~1,000 tweets in 20-60 minutes

   ```

### Using the Console Script

1. **Navigate to your X profile:**
   ```
   https://x.com/yourusername
   ```

2. **Open Console** (`F12` or `Cmd+Option+J`)

3. **Paste the script** from [`src/delete-x-content.js`](src/delete-x-content.js) (bottom section)

4. **Watch it run:**
   - Console shows: "Deleted 1", "Deleted 2", etc.
   - Keep browser focused on the tab
   - Don't close or minimize

5. **Repeat for other tabs:**
   - Click "Replies" tab on your profile
   - Run script again
   - Check "Media" if needed

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Script Stops or Gets Stuck

**Solution:**
- Refresh the page
- Re-run the script
- It will continue from where it left off

### "Rate Limited" or Account Blocked

**Solution:**
- Wait 15-30 minutes
- X will automatically unblock
- Resume deletion process

### No Tweets Being Deleted

**Possible causes:**
- X changed their UI (selectors outdated)
- Not logged in properly
- Network issues
- Profile is protected/locked

**Solutions:**
- Verify you're logged in
- Check browser console for errors
- Try the alternative console script method
- Update selectors in script (if X UI changed)

### Browser Keeps Timing Out

**Solution:**
- Reduce script speed (increase delays)
- Run during off-peak hours (late night)
- Ensure stable internet connection

### Some Tweets Still Remain

**Why:**
- Very old tweets may not load in profile
- Tweets may be cached in X search
- Hidden/archived content

**Solution:**
- Manually delete remaining tweets
- Wait 24-48 hours for cache to clear
- Check "Archive" section in settings

## 🎓 Advanced Usage

### Customizing Delays

Edit `src/delete-x-content.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  delays: {
    betweenClicks: 500,      // Increase to 1000 if rate limited
    afterDeletion: 1000,     // Increase to 2000 for safety
    scrollLoad: 3000,        // Increase to 5000 if slow loading
    rateLimitSafe: 1000      // Increase to 2000-3000 if aggressive
  },
  // ...
};
```

### Deleting Only Specific Content

Modify the `deleteAllContent` function to only call specific deletion types:

```javascript
// Only delete replies
summary.replies = await deleteContent(mcpTools, username, 'REPLIES');
```

### Adding Progress Notifications

Add console logs or alerts:

```javascript
if (deletedCount % 50 === 0) {
  console.log(`🎉 Milestone: ${deletedCount} items deleted!`);
  // Or: alert(`Progress: ${deletedCount} deleted`);
}
```
